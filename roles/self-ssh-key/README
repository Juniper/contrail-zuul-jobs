A role that:
1) ensures that user has a ~/.ssh/id_rsa key generated
2) adds this key to user's authorized_keys

This way the user is able to log in to the local machine via ssh
without password. Username can be set via the `user` var, defaults to root.
This role is used for same-node deployments requiring ssh access
to localhost (e.g. contrail-ansible-deployer).
