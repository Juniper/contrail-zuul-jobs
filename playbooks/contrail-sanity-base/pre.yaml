# support for multinode deployments
# * If deployment node exists:
#   - generates an ssh key for the deployment user on the deployment node
#   - distributes the public part of the key to allow access on all nodeset nodes
#   - install docker on it
#   - add the insecure docker registry to it
# * Inserts dns entries about all nodeset nodes in /etc/hosts on all nodeset nodes

# Support for AIO deployments
# contrail-ansible-deployer docker in a different version / from a different repo than in c-z-j
# TODO: work this out, so installation methods are in sync
